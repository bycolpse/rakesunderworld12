    <div class="description">
      <p>You wake up as a normal person. It's actually a very normal day. You receive that email. The email asks you to solve the massacre that happened in the restaurant and the incident there. A very high money offer comes to your mailbox and it is said that money will come when you complete that task. You take your friends or yourself and go there. Are you ready for the joy of destroying that mysterious moon base in space from what seems like a normal event? </p>

    <h3>What is Psychological Horror?</h3>
    <p class="psychological-horror-description">
      Psychological horror is a subgenre of horror that emphasizes the psychological state of characters, using fear, tension, and dread to unsettle the audience. Instead of relying on visual shock or gore, it plays with the mind, making you question what is real and what is imagined. It often involves complex themes like isolation, madness, and the terror of the unknown. The fear comes from within, from the characters’ own minds, making it more personal and often much more disturbing.
